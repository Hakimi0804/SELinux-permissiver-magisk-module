# What the Fuck is this? Isn't there a lot of permissiver magisk module?

- Short answer: I'm bored
- Long answer: So a random permissiver that i found somewhat does not work properly on realme UI (it causes audio to broke wtf), but it does works properly on dotOS. Instead of finding another permissiver, I decided to make one myself cuz I'm bored lmao

and well it seems to work properly
